                  <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
                  <p> When it was time for me to give a sturdy and well thought kick start to my career, my journey brought me to the doorstep of NTT  DATA, NTT  is the workplace where I am currently working as a Software Developer and have sharpened my skill sets. It is a meaningful vocation for me as I could essay the role of a Software Developer over here.
                  I played an important part as a team member who was always ready for more work.</p>

                  <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
                  <p>An unquenchable thirst for knowledge coupled with an inherent drive to do something different have always been the propelling factors influencing my choices, eventually I secured myself a seat in Computer Science Engineering in one of the reputed colleges, Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology, affiliated to Osmania University. This marked the beginning of one of the most important phase of learning in my life. This course took me a step closer towards fulfillment of my goal of delving deeper into the world of science.</p> 

                  <h3>EXTRA CURRICULAR</h3>
                  <p>
                  In addition to my academic achievements, I have been very active outside the classroom and have participated in many extracurricular activities including debates and sports. Active participation in a wide range of extracurricular activities has ensured the all round development of my personality. Apart from this, I have also been the CRM and Sports Captain of the Computer Society of India (CSI) Students Chapter of my college where I have organized and volunteered for many inter-college festival events (attended by nearly 2000 people). Teaching the underprivileged youth of Telangana minority residential Educational schools in Hyderabad has been an invigorating experience. This experience brought to the fore my leadership abilities, while also assisting in honing my social skills I have been volunteering for my community drives for a long time.</p>
